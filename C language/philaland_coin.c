/*The problem solvers have found a new Island for coding and named it as Philaland. These smart
people were given a task to make a purchase of items at the Island easier by distributing various
coins with different values. Manish has come up with a solution that if we make coins category
starting from $1 till the maximum price of the item present on Island, then we can purchase any
item easily. He added the following example to prove his point.
Letâ€™s suppose the maximum price of an item is 5$ then we can make coins of {$1, $2, $3, $4,
$5}to purchase any item ranging from $1 till $5.
Now Manisha, being a keen observer suggested that we could actually minimize the number of
coins required and gave following distribution {$1, $2, $3}. According to him any item can be
purchased one time ranging from $1 to $5. Everyone was impressed with both of them. Your
task is to help Manisha come up with a minimum number of denominations for any arbitrary
max price in Philaland.

Input Format
Contains an integer N denoting the maximum price of the item present on Philaland.

Output Format
Print a single line denoting the minimum number of denominations of coins required.*/
